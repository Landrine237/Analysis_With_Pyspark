#BIG DATA , the data generated by the usage of new technologies to personal or professional purposes , remain the biggest field of management data until right now. The data are overly voluminous , to the point where
traditional databases can't handle it , thus the born of the tools like Hodoop , Spark etc....
Spark it's a distributed and open source framework which allows data to be processed in real time and batches at scale. To make it possible , spark uses programmation languages like python , scala , java , R.
What about Python Spark , that's our target. The meeting between SPARK and python language give birth to #PYSPARK. #PYSPARK it's a python librairie which allows users to use the spark framework , it's provides a python
interface to interact with spark thus allowing you to exploit the power of spark with the python programmation language.

In this repository , you'll find all my data analysis projets with pyspark(without visualizations) or pandas-on-spark(with visualizations) , please feel free to make a comment , or a advice , and don't forget #the starâœ¨
if you found the content good.
